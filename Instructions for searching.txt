How to search for words:
First read in the Tracker 1 and 2 text files into a tracker object. We didn't write a function for this,
but it shouldn't be too hard to figure out.
Use the tryout everywhere function to fill in a common word, with spaces left and right, such as ' the ',
and it will loop through all of the positions. Most of the results won't make sense, but if you see some
result that seems to make sense, you can try and complete the word with the tryout function. You should
reverse the flag (if you had true in the tryout everything, set it to false in the tryout), and try to
complete the word fragment that you found. If you do find a word you are certain of, add it to the tracker.
Besides common words, you could also try word endings such as -able or -ness.
